# 🏦 Loan Prediction Project

This project is a Machine Learning-based solution for predicting whether a loan should be approved or not based on applicant details. It helps banks and financial institutions make faster and more accurate loan eligibility decisions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to build a predictive model using historical loan application data. The model classifies whether a loan should be approved (`Y`) or rejected (`N`) based on various features such as income, loan amount, credit history, etc.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Loan_prediction/ ├── data/              # Dataset files (train/test) ├── notebooks/         # Jupyter Notebooks for EDA and modeling ├── models/            # Saved trained models ├── Loan_Prediction.ipynb  # Main notebook ├── requirements.txt   # Python dependencies └── README.md          # Project documentation

## 📊 Features Used

- Gender
- Married
- Dependents
- Education
- Self_Employed
- ApplicantIncome
- CoapplicantIncome
- LoanAmount
- Loan_Amount_Term
- Credit_History
- Property_Area

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categoricals, feature scaling)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Logistic Regression / Random Forest Classifier
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve)

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kowsik-namadi/Loan_prediction.git
   cd Loan_prediction

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


3. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook Loan_Prediction.ipynb



📈 Model Performance

Accuracy: ~XX% (update with your result)

Precision & Recall: Evaluated using confusion matrix and ROC-AUC

Best Model: Logistic Regression (or whichever you finalized)


🛠️ Future Enhancements

Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit

Add a web interface for user input

Improve model accuracy with advanced techniques (XGBoost, GridSearchCV)
